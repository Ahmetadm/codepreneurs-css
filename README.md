# Challenge 04  - CSS FLEX

For this weekâ€™s challenge, I had to create a Full Responsive web page with using FLEX PROPERTIES
Key points for this challenge was:

- to use FLEX properties while positioning the elements
- to have dropdown menu with using CSS only
- To have Responsive navigation menu but it didnt have to be functional. it was enough to show the hamburger menu icon in mobile version of the web page but  as an extra challenge for me, I made the hamburger menu functional without using Javascript and without using awesome font.
To make it functional, i used checkbox and label for a click action. The checkbox is hidden but the hamburger icon itself is a label for the checkbox. Whenever you click the hamburger menu, it checks the checkbox and toggles the nav menu, and the hamburger menu becomes "X". Same whenever you uncheck the checkbox with clicking to X, it becomes Hameburger menu and scales down the nav menu to make it invisible.
Added some interesting animation to the hamburger menu as well.
Closing button in the nav has an hover animation as well.
